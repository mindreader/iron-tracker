I have a strong urge to do fitness, but a frustratingly low urge to do the book keeping I need to stay on track.

This application currently fulfills:
* A long list of exercises of varying types can be input into the program.
* A subset of those exercises can be declared as part of your current workout.
* Saves your proficiency in each exercise in the form of "I was able to do 5 reps at 100 lbs/kg"
* Allows you to display your workout with a different rep target.  Uses epley formula to convert above statement to new reps.

This application is planned to fulfill:
* I want to log when you update an exercise, so that the app can tell you when you last worked out for each exercise, and tick them off as you do them.
* I'd like to be able to sort the exercises somehow, perhaps by weight?  That's generally the order I do them in.
* I also want to get a log stored in a database, perhaps mongodb or just sqlite.  I'm not sure yet.
* The ability to keep a recipe store that primarily tells you calorie and protein (in grams) of any food in its database at a glance.
* The ability to slightly modify a recipe you are inputting so like if you used less meat, or more noodles, it will adjust.
* As with exercises, I want to be able to store a daily food log so that I can get an idea of what I'm eating each day.
